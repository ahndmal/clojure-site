== Real-world-data meeting 2

Hi! +
On March 22nd, we had the first meeting of the real-world-data group. About 12 attended (of the 19 who joined the group). +
Please see the meeting 1 post for background. +
This study group is a bit different from the other ones. Participants are assumed to be actively working on a problem and willing to share it in the group. +
If you wish to join the group, please reach out beforehand.  +
